Elite101-PreWork
This respository contains my pre-wordk project for the Elite 101 course at code2college.
The project is a python Chatbot. Mine has a bit of a personality and attitude ;)
The user can stop the chat by typing "goodbye" and at the end can keep chatting for as long as they want. If they don't say anything, the chatbot says "absolutely speechless" :)
I commented where I used some code from some of the chatbot examples. 
Problem Statement: Your task is to build a chatbot that will simulate a conversation with the user. The amount of responses and how they are generated are up to you, but the conversation should continue until the user chooses to end it.
